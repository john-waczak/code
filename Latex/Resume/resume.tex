\section{\sc Experience}
%%%%%%
{\bf Roundy Research Group}, Oregon State University \hfill{January 2017 -- Present}\\
{\em Undergraduate Researcher}\hfill \scriptsize{\url{github.com/john-waczak/dynein_walk}}\\
I am working with Dr. Roundy to develop and test computational simulations which evaluate a physical model for the locomotion of Dynein, a cellular motor protein. My duties include editing simulation code (C++), writing scripts to analyze and visualize large data sets (python), exploring the simulation space to find the best set of parameters to produce \textit{physical} behavior, and presenting work at weekly group meetings.
%%%%%%

{\bf Cooper Environmental Services}, Beaverton, OR \hfill{March 2015 -- September 2017}\\
{\em Intern} \\
I Worked in the lab to evaluate the physical and chemical properties of various filter media in order help the company decide which filter to use in the Xact Ambient Metals Monitor. I designed and implemented controller logic (using a PID loop) for controlling a vacuum pump through c\# in conjunction with a National Instruments IO board. Using Modbus serial communications protocol, I created code to make data accessible locally with a Modbus slave device. I wrote code using SQLite to send the same data to a local database for long term storage.
