  \opening{Dear Student Evaluation Committee,}
  
  I am writing to you today in evaluation of Dr. Ryan Hass as a mathematics instructor. I have had the privilege to take two classes from Dr. Hass: MTH 256 and MTH 351. I took the first of these classes in my freshman year at Oregon State university. Dr. Hass taught the material very well, but more importantly, he fostered a very engaging learning environment in which I was comfortable asking questions. Differential equations are a difficult subject when first encountered and Dr. Hass's clear lectures and use of a plethora of examples made the material far more accessible and interesting. \\ 
  
  Last year I took MTH 351 from Dr. Hass in order to satisfy the computational requirement of the mathematics degree. Due to my physics background, I have had a lot of experience solving computational problems. Dr. Hass was recognized this and would often ask me extra questions or point out interesting connections to other topics as we spent time working in groups to write simple programs using Matlab. This kept me interested in the material and it made me appreciate how the topics we covered were applicable to many of the problems I was working on outside of the class room.  \\ 
  
  Both experiences I have had as a student of Dr. Hass have been great. He is a wonderful professor and I hope my testimony will reflect positively in your consideration for this promotion. If you have any other questions for me, please feel free to reach out.
